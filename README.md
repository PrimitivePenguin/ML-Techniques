# ML-Techniques
Creating ML techniques from "A Survey on Machine Learning Approaches and Its Techniques (2020)" to explore the field of ML

chainer_ai.py is inspired by chainer documentation. Used mini-batch learning on DNN, and ReLU as the activation function. Chainer is outdated, so I'm planning to update it to customize to pytorch and tensorflow.
